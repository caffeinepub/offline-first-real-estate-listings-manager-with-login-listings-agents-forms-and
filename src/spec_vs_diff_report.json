REQ-1 (actual regenerated PNG branding assets and favicon/manifest references) and REQ-3 (production rebuild/redeploy producing a working icp0.io URL) are not evidenced in the diff. The backend received substantial new functionality unrelated to the branding/redeploy request, suggesting hallucinated scope.",
