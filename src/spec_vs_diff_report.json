  "summary": "REQ-1/2/3/4 appear implemented in the frontend (customer category dropdown + legacy fallback, matching properties on customer details, dashboard match computation with local dismissal persistence, and reminder creation gated behind an Add Reminder dialog). REQ-5 is only partially implemented: the new “Excel” I/O utility exports/imports CSV (not .xlsx), so the explicit .xlsx requirement is not met based on the diff evidence. The diff also includes several unrelated features (auth/branding/navigation/online indicator) that were not requested.",
